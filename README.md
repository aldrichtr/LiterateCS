# Literate Programming in C# and .NET Core

[Literate Programming] is a programming methodology that helps writing and 
maintaining software by uniting code and documentation. It makes writing 
documentation a less arduous task by providing the tooling for creating 
clear, professional-looking documentation from your code. Some argue that 
it also improves the quality of your code by encouraging you to write it 
in a way that is easier to follow.

This project is an attempt to make literate programming easy and fun for C#
programmers. The full description of the project is available in: 

<https://johtela.github.io/LiterateCS/>

Please browse through the web site to get an idea what literate programming 
is and how LiterateCS helps you apply its principles.

## Download and Installation

The project was initially written for .NET Framework, but I recently
modified it to target [.NET Core 2.1]. It is available in <https://nuget.org>
as an [.NET Core global tool].

See the [installation instructions] for more details. Documentation of the
command line options and usage examples can be found [here][options].
