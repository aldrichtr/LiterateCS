# Literate Programming in C# and .NET Core

[Literate Programming] is a programming methodology that helps writing and 
maintaining software by uniting code and documentation. It makes writing 
documentation less arduous task, and improves the quality and utility of 
the written documentation. Some argue that it also improves the quality 
of the produced code by forcing the author write it in such a way that 
it is clear to the readers.

This project is an attempt to make literate programming easy and fun for C#
programmers. The full description of the project is available in: 

<https://johtela.github.io/LiterateCS/>

Please browse through the web site to get an idea what literate programming 
is and how the LiterateCS helps you practicing it.

## Download and Installation

The project was initially written for .NET Framework, but I recently
modified it to target [.NET Core 2.1]. It is available in <https://nuget.org>
as an [.NET Core global tool].

See the [installation instructions] for more details.
